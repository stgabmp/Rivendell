The following AudioScience audio adapters have been tested with
Rivendell.  Most work fine with the package.  A few have issues, which
are noted.

     ASI4111 -- No level meter in RDAirPlay, meters should otherwise work
                properly with 'UseStreamMeters=Yes' in the [Hacks]
                section of '/etc/rd.conf'.
     ASI4113 -- No level meter in RDAirPlay, meters should otherwise work
                properly with 'UseStreamMeters=Yes' in the [Hacks]
                section of '/etc/rd.conf'.
     ASI4215 -- No level meter in RDAirPlay, meters should otherwise work
                properly with 'UseStreamMeters=Yes' in the [Hacks]
                section of '/etc/rd.conf'.  Due to the unique mixer 
		architecture of this card, only output number 4 is
                supported.
