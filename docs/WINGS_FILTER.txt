          Usage Notes for the 'wings_filter' Import Script.

Wings_filter is a script designed to be used to import existing audio
and meta-data from an AirForce 'Wings' automation system.  It is
invoked as follows:

USAGE

wings_filter -g <default-group> -d <db-file> -A <audio-dir> [-e <audio-ext>]

Where:
  <default-group> = The name of the group in which to place carts
                    belonging to a source tab in Wings for which there
                    is no corresponding Rivendell Group.

        <db-file> = The name of the Wings database file.

      <audio-dir> = The name of the directory containing the Wings ATX
                    audio files.

      <audio-ext> = The filetype extension fo the Wings ATX files.  By
                    default, this is 'ATX', but can be changed to
                    other values here if necessary.


OVERVIEW
In order import audio from an existing Wings system, proceed as
follows:

1) CREATE RIVENDELL GROUPS
In RDAdmin->ManageGroups, create a Group to correspond to each Wings
Tab value that exists in the library to be imported, and an additional
group to catch any Wings entries that may not have a valid Group.
When creating these groups, it is essential that a default cart number
range be configured for each group that is large enough to accomodate
all anticipated imports.

2) LOCATE THE 'WINGS' DATABASE AND AUDIO FILES
These can be mounted from a remote system if needs be.  Read-only
access is adequate, as the script does not modify these items in any
way.

3) VERIFY AVAILABLE DISK SPACE
Verify that enough disk space is available in the '/var/snd/'
directory to accomodate the audio to be imported.  You should have at
least the amount of space currently occupied by the Wings ATX files,
plus 5 percent additional.  

4) INVOKE SCRIPT
Start up the script, as described in the USAGE section above.  The
script will print progress reports as it proceeds, or notify you of
error conditions as required.

5) CLEAN UP
If desired, use RDAdmin->ManageGroups to rename the single-letter
import groups to more intuitive names.


NOTE ON AUDIO PROCESSING
Wings_filter does not alter or reencode the audio sample data in any
way, and thus does *not* incurr any generation or transcoding loss of
quality.  At the same time, this means that the incoming audio will be
brought into Rivendell *exactly* as it exists in the Wings system,
with all parameters (e.g. sample rate, bit rate, level, etc)
unaltered.  If you need to alter one or more of these parameters as
part of the import process, we suggest you use the RDImport script
instead.
