          Usage Notes for the 'rivendell_filter' Import Script.

Rivendell_filter is a script designed to be used to import existing audio
and meta-data from another Rivendell system.  It is invoked as follows:

USAGE

rivendell_filter -h <hostname> -u <username> -p <password> -A <audio-dir>
-g <default-group> -s <start-cartnum> -e <end-cartnum>
Where:
       <hostname> = The MySQL hostname of the source Rivendell database.

       <username> = The MySQL username of the source Rivendell database.

       <password> = The MySQL password of the source Rivendell database.

      <audio-dir> = The name of the directory containing the source
                    Rivendell audio files.

  <default-group> = The name of the group in which to place carts
                    belonging to a source Group for which there
                    is no corresponding destination Group.

  <start-cartnum> = The first cart in the range of those to be transferred.

    <end-cartnum> = The last cart in the range of those to be trasnferred.

OVERVIEW
In order transfer carts from an external Rivendell system, proceed as
follows:

1) CREATE RIVENDELL GROUPS
In RDAdmin->ManageGroups, create a Group to correspond to each Rivendell
Group that exists in the library to be imported, and an additional
group to catch any carts that may not have a corresponding Group.

2) LOCATE THE EXTERNAL RIVENDELL DATABASE AND AUDIO FILES
The directory containing the audio files can be mounted from a remote
system if needs be.  Read-only access is adequate (and in fact recommended),
as the script does not modify these items in any way.

3) VERIFY AVAILABLE DISK SPACE
Verify that enough disk space is available in the '/var/snd/'
directory of the destination system to accomodate the audio to be 
imported.  You should have at least the amount of space currently occupied
by the source files, plus 5 percent additional.  

4) INVOKE SCRIPT
Start up the script, as described in the USAGE section above.  The
script will print progress reports as it proceeds, or notify you of
error conditions as required.

WARNING
If a cart from the source system has the same number as one one the
destination, the destination cart (data and *all* audio) will be overwritten!

NOTE ON AUDIO PROCESSING
Rivendell_filter does not alter or reencode the audio sample data in any
way, and thus does *not* incurr any generation or transcoding loss of
quality.  At the same time, this means that the incoming audio will be
brought into the new Rivendell system *exactly* as it exists in the 
source system, with all parameters (e.g. sample rate, bit rate, level,
etc) unaltered.  If you need to alter one or more of these parameters as
part of the import process, we suggest you use the RDImport script
instead.

NOTE ON GROUP ASSIGNMENTS
WARNING: Rivendell_filter makes no attempt to enforce group numbering rules!
If a group to which a given source cart belongs exists on the destination
system, the cart will be placed in that group, regardless of numbering rules.
