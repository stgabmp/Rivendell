                    WINDOWS SUPPORT FOR RIVENDELL

A Windows port of Rivendell exists, consisting of just the RDLogEdit,
RDLogManager and RMLSend tools, primarily intended for use on systems 
employing Windows-based traffic and music schedulers.  Current binary
versions can be found at:

   ftp://ftp.salemradiolabs.com/pub/srlabs/rivendell/win32/

If you wish to build the Windows port from source, please see the
'INSTALL' file.


INSTALLING THE BIANRY VERSION
The binary version comes with a standard setup program that will do
most of the work of getting Rivendell installed.  After the
installation is complete, you will need to edit the 'rd.ini' file,
located in the Rivendell installation directory (by default, 
'C:\ProgramFiles\SalemRadioLabs\Rivendell\') and supply the hostname
and login password to the 'rduser' account on the site's mySQL server.
This file can contain all of the directives and arguments used in
Rivendell's standard '/etc/rd.conf' file (although only a few will
have any real effect in the Windows envrionment).  The default
file provided should help get you started.
