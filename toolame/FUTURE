Feel free to contribute code for any of the following 
(they're listed in some sort of priority)
	- Bring in some of LAME's gpsycho model
	- fix the FLOAT, float, double definitions
	- updated VBR mode. (improved VBR_a_bit_allocation)
	- reading from stdin could be made less kludgy I suppose.
	- psy-model speed ups
	- a_bit_allocation optimization
